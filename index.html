      <p>I am Kira -  a 16-year-old high school student studying coding over summer. I love music, especially playing guitar, as well as drawing and crafting. So far my crafts consist of masks and making dolls out of felt. In the Portfolio tab, there are images of my crafts with brief descriptions about them.</p>
